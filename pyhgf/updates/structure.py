    Parameters
    ----------
    attributes :
        The attributes of the existing network.
    edges :
        The edges of the existing network.
    index :
        The index of the node you want to connect a new parent node to.
    coupling_type :

=======
>>>>>>> 1f7b8c2 (initial update for-loop added to notebook. Mean of new parent node added to add_parent function)
        The type of coupling you want between the existing node and it's new parent.
        Can be either "value" or "volatility".
    mean :
        The mean value of the new parent node.
